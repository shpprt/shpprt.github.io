              2024’s total solar eclipse took place over Miami University’s 
              campus, and the Richard and Carole Cocks Art Museum took the 
              opportunity to hold a watch party on the front lawn. There 
              already existed marketing material for eclipse events around 
              the city of Oxford, so I was tasked to convert the design 
              into a motion graphic for the art museum to use.

            <p>
              The motivation I had for creating motion graphics propelled me 
              to finish the project in only a week. I learned encrypted text 
              effects and more advanced compositing in After Effects. When 
              posted, the instagram reel received 50% more views than normal.

              The city of Oxford saw my animation and requested an altered 
              version of it with their solar eclipse related events to replace 
              the art museum’s events. I learned a lot of things about after 
              effects throughout the project, including the encrypted text 
              effect and more advanced compositing.
