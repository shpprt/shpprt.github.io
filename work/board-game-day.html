            <p>My communication design major in college was rigid with little to no cohort mingling, 
              so I took initiative and organized an event called Board Game Day to foster connection 
              across cohorts. Board Game Day was an independent project that combined board games, 
              food, and designers. I rented out a room and advertised the event across the art 
              buildings. The event turnout was 38 people, including 10 seniors, 20 juniors, and 8 
              sophomores.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              This was one of many events I ran independently. To make events like this more 
              sustainable and frequent, I partnered with a friend to create a student organization 
              called Design Collective, of which I am the Event Coordinator. We are continuing to grow 
              our student group that will unite design cohorts beyond our graduation.
