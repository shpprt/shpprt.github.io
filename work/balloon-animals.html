            <p>Through 9 juried Student Response Exhibitions over the past 11 years, 
              the Richard and Carole Cocks Art Museum at Miami University has encouraged 
              students to creatively reflect and respond through artistic expression 
              for the community to engage with and interpret.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2023, the exhibition It's Our World was composed of 22 artists and 31 
              works. Students responded to our changing environment, illustrating how 
              creative expression can be used to observe, understand, represent, and draw 
              attention to environmental issues that face individuals and the collective 
              in the one world we share.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Here is my response: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>As the environment continues to suffer at the hands of humans, animals all 
              over the world are forced to seek refuge in the last, untouched ecosystem: 
              the sky. The adage "the sky's the limit", once a source of inspiration, now 
              rings hollow for a future that seems hopelessly lost. The many creatures that 
              dot the clouds capture the diversity of wildlife, highlighting nature's 
              acceptance of all species. It's often said that nature is unforgiving, yet 
              roaring monsoons and thunderous tornadoes cannot compete with humanityâ€™s 
              intolerance for the natural world.
